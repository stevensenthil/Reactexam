1. Use of Context?
      Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.
      Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult. 
      If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

2. What is useconex and use reduser?
      useContext - a react hook, allowing functional components to take advantage of the context API. 
      useReducer - a react hook, used in place of useState , generally for more complex state. 
      dispatch - a function returned to us by useReducer , which sends action objects to the reducer function

3. How to update state in context?
       To update state in context, use the `useState` hook within the context provider component and provide a function to update the state.

4. What is create context ?write it purpose
        `createContext` is a function in React used to create a context object, which helps in sharing state and data across components efficiently.

5. Context.Provider and Context.consumer?
        Context allows components to access shared data, the provider sets the context's value, and the consumer consumes it within nested components.

6. Difference b/w Redux and Context?
        Redux is a state management library, while Context is a feature in React for sharing state locally. Redux is more suitable for complex applications.

7. Purpose of useSelector and useDispatch hook?
         `useSelector` is for accessing specific parts of Redux store state, and `useDispatch` is used to dispatch actions in React Redux.

8. Use of Fragment?
           Fragments in React allow grouping multiple elements without introducing extra parent divs in the DOM.

9. What is Store in Redux
   In Redux, a store is a centralized place to store application state.

10. How to read initialstate and reduser for in redux?
   Initial state is defined when creating a Redux store, and the reducer function specifies how state changes in response to actions.

11. What is sass and uses?
    SCSS is a superset of CSS that adds features like variables and nesting for more maintainable and organized styles.

12. Difference b/w scss & css
    SCSS is a preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables and nesting, making stylesheets more modular and maintainable compared to traditional CSS.

13. Why are go for lifecycle? 
    Lifecycle methods in React allow you to perform actions at specific stages of a component's life, like componentDidMount for initial setup.

14. WHich one is better Redux or Context ?Give reason
    The choice between Redux and Context depends on the project's complexity; Redux is better for larger, more complex applications, while Context is simpler and suitable for smaller ones.

15. How many slice created in redex and how many store created in redux
    Redux can have multiple slices for different parts of the state, but typically, there's one store for the entire application.
