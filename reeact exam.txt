1. In React, what is the purpose of the componentWillUpdate lifecycle method?

    To perform actions before the component is re-rendered due to state or props changes.


2. Which lifecycle method is commonly used to initialize state or perform other setup operations in a React component?

   componentDidMount   


3. In React, what is the primary use case for the componentWillUnmount lifecycle method?

   To perform cleanup operations before the component is removed from the DOM.


4. What happens when you modify the state directly without using the setState method in a React component?

   It updates the state but does not trigger a re-render.


5. How can you update component state in a functional component in React?
 
   By calling the useState hook with new values.


6. In React, what is the primary purpose of the componentDidMount lifecycle method?

   To perform initial setup and data fetching after the component is added to the DOM.


7. How can you access the current state of a React component within its render method?

   By referencing this.state.


8. Which of the following scenarios is a suitable use case for using the componentWillUpdate lifecycle method?

   To perform validation of incoming props before rendering.


9. In a class component, which lifecycle method is used for fetching data from an API?

   componentDidMount()


10. What is the purpose of the constructor method in a React class component?

    To initialize component state and bind event handlers.


11. When using the map function to render a list of items in React, why is it important to provide a unique key prop to each rendered element?

    It helps React efficiently identify which elements have changed, been added, or been removed when updating the list.


12. What is the key difference between state and props in a React component?

    State is immutable, while props can change.


13. In React, what is a controlled component?

    A component that receives data through props and notifies changes using callbacks.


14. How do you pass data from a child component to a parent component in React?

    By calling a callback function passed as a prop from the parent to the child component.


15. How can you conditionally render a component in React JSX based on a boolean variable isVisible?

    {isVisible && } <Component />}



16. Which of the following is NOT a valid way to set the initial state of a React component? 
  
    Using the componentWillMount lifecycle method.


17. How can you update component state in React without using the this.setState method?

    It is not recommended to update state without this.setState.



18. In a React class component, where should you perform asynchronous data fetching and update the component's state based on the fetched data?

    In the componentDidMount method.


19. How can you pass data from a parent component to a child component in React using props?

    By defining a prop in the child component's JSX element when rendering it in the parent component.


20. In React, what is the primary purpose of the componentDidUpdate lifecycle method?

    To perform side effects after the component has re-rendered due to state or props changes.
